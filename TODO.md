ux:
- show formula compile errors
- SPACE to toggle play/stop

bugs:
- do not emit effects for out-of-screen notes
- sometimes "encoding" status doesn't go away during play
- check if misplays are working (act 2 mission 2)

levels:
1. explains that targets need to be marked/triggered
2. introduces multi-instrument tracks, forbids functions
3. ???
4. different target sizes
5. optional targets
6. outline elements & misplays (penalty targets)
7. period echo range trick
8. after/until func combo
9. avoid optional targets
