instruments:
- functions for periods?
- constants like pi pi/2 for periods?

ux:
- show formula compile errors
- esc should go back

missions:
- pre-mission screen
- victory condition
- load targets from a map/level file

puzzle elements:
- higher period - bigger explosion, but lower attack rate
- some targets have func-based immunities

bugs:
- do not emit effects for out-of-screen notes
- when loading/starting, all instruments should be prepared immediately

levels:
1. explains that targets need to be marked/triggered
2. introduces multi-instrument tracks, forbids functions
3. ???
4. different target sizes
5. optional targets
6. outline elements & misplays (penalty targets)
7. period echo range trick
8. after/until func combo

bonus conditions:
+ max number of instruments
+ don't use some function
